        <h2>Directions: Crispy Baked Wings</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Dry overnight (optional) - </strong>If you plan ahead, lay the wings
                on a rack on a rimmed baking tray and let them dry uncovered in the fridge 
                overnight. Alternatively, pat them dry with paper towels.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Preheat</strong> the oven to 250 degrees F / 120 degrees C (all oven types).
                Put one oven shelf in the lower quarter of the oven and one in the top quarter.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Line the tray</strong> with foil. Put a rack on the tray then spray the rack with oil.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Toss wings - </strong>Place the wings in a large bowl. Sprinkle over baking powder and 
                salt. Use hands to toss well (or shake in ziplock bag) to coat wings evenly.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bake 30 minutes on low temp - </strong>Place the wings skin side up on the rack (ok if snug, 
                they shrink). bake on the lower shelf in the oven for 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bake 40 minutes on high - </strong>Move the tray up to the higher shelf and turn the oven up to 
                425 degrees F / 220 degrees C (all oven types). Bake for a further 40 to 50 minutes, rotating the tray 
                halfway through. The wings do not need to turned over. They are ready when dark golden brown and the skin 
                is very crispy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Toss in sauce - </strong>Transfer the wings into a large bowl. Pour over sauce and toss to coat. 
                (Alternatively, serve wings plain with Buffalo Sauce for dipping).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Serve</strong> immediately with Blue Cheese Dip (for both wings and celery sticks dunking)!
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Directions: Sauce</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Whisk together the Sauce ingredients until the sugar is melted. Keep warm or reheat just prior to using.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Directions: Blue Cheese Dip</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Mash the blue cheese with sour cream until smooth (or to your taste).
            </li>
            <li>
                Add remaining ingredients and mix well until combined, using milk to get it to the consistency you want. Store 
                in the fridge until required. Remove from the fridge 15 minutes before serving.
